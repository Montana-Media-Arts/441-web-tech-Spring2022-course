# Future TODO's

- When I introduce info on selecting and changing elements on HTML pages, include this page on the "DOM" by MDN
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction


- Eventually, I should add a TOC to the front-page, that lists week #'s **WITH** topics covered. i.e.;
    - [Week-4; Functions, Arrays, & Objects]
    - [Week-8; Intro to the DOM](/path-to-overview/)
