# Homework

In this assignment, you are going to create some art! You are going to set up your page with some shapes, some text, and some images. You are doing to have the imagery fade in and fade out. You are going to move the shapes around, and you have the text increase and decrease in size. Your piece must rotate between different images, text, and shapes. This rotation will require the use of arrays, which I know you love!

Technical specifications:

1. Create a page that uses jQuery. You can either have it locally or use a CDN.
2. Add images that fade in and out.
3. Rotate between different images each time an image fades out.
4. Add text onto the screen. It can be quotes, words of wisdom, or just words.
5. You should rotate through different words as well after a certain time.
6. You are going to have different shapes that move around the screen too.
7. These shapes should move for a specific time, and then they should fade out, and a different image should appear.
