What is HTML5?  HTML5 is the successor of HTML4.  This semester, we have been working primarily with HTML4.  Most of those elements and tags still exist in HTML5.  However, HTML5 gives us several new tags in which we can employ.  We will cover some of the original tags and how we can use them in our applications.  We will pay particular focus to the audio, video, and canvas tags as they will allow us to create web-based games.
