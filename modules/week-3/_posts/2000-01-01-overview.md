For this week and the next couple of weeks, we will explore the basic concepts and techniques of coding in JavaScript.

Most of you will already have taken [MART120 - Creative Coding 1](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/120_CreativeCoding1-Fall2020/). For those of you who have taken 120, this will be a review for you. I feel comfortable asking you to review this material through the lens of vanilla JavaScript, as opposed to the gentler p5 lens.

For those of you who have not taken 120, this will be new material. Take your time, work through this material slowly and methodically (i.e., I would be reading deep and not skimming). Remember, if you have questions while you work through the content this week, post them to the [GitHub-hosted Issues-Forum](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/441-WebTech-Spring2021-Examples/issues) or of course **Discord**.

For everyone, I again would encourage you to consider developing a study group that you can meet with once a week. If you get in the habit now of meeting with these people, when the content gets difficult later this semester, you will have a group with whom to work. Please feel free to use the issues-forum to arrange groups if you are so inclined.  Of course, you can always contact me too!
