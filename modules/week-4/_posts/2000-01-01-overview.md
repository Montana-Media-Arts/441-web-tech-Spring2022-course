We will continue this week on our journey through critical concepts of programming, as expressed through JavaScript. This week, you will explore;

- variables again (more exposure is a good thing!)
- functions - in more depth
- control structures
- loops
- the math object

We are going to continue to add more functionality to our story and make it more fun.
