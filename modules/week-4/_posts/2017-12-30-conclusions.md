# Weekly Conclusions

This week we covered a lot in more depth.  The good thing is that if you get these concepts down, you will find that all languages have these similar techniques.  Also, this won't be the last time you see them.  We will do more so that you get a chance to work with these again. These are, however, critical skills for your work in this course and future artistic web development work. Take the time to get to know this material and work through the problems.

Next week, we will examine Arrays, Objects, and how to use them with all these concepts.  We are in the fun stuff now!
