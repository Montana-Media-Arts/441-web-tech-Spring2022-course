# Homework 2


<a href="https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/441-WebTech-Spring2021-Examples/tree/master/Week%202" target="_new">Example from this week</a>

For your homework this week, extend your first web page that uses the console.log and adds some comments. You are welcome to make something display on the page like an image or something.

1. Execute the log from a separate JavaScript file that you link to from your HTML document.
    - Use the script tag at the end of your HTML document to do this
2. The console.log should include;
    - 3 of your favorite websites
    - 3 of your favorite games
    - 3 of your favorite artists
   
3. You should set a primary background color for your document using a style element within the HTML document's head element.

As always, you should also write a readme.md and put that in your directory. Discuss your progress this week with the introduction to JS and your console example.

Your directory should look like the following;

```
Git-Repo
├── HW-1/
├── HW-2/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── readme.md
│   └── script.js
├── README.md
└── index.html
```

Also, you will answer the question in the week-2 Moodle forum and submit your links in the homework area in Moodle.  Feel free to paste your links into a file (docx, PDF, etc.) and submit your file into Moodle.
