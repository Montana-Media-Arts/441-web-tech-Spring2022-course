## For this Week

For this week, please go through Code Academy's Introduction to JavaScript.  Just complete 1-3 of the Introduction.  There are some readings along with some simple exercises to reinforce the console.log and creating comments.

Also, if you are interested and you have a mobile phone, you can look for Grasshopper, and it's a fun way to learn JavaScript as well. [Grasshopper](https://grasshopper.codes/)
