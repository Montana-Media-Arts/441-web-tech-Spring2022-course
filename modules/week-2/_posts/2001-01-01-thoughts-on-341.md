# Thoughts on MART 341<br>Wrapping up HTML & CSS

<!-- Potentially remove this page in future iterations -->


For those of you still struggling with HTML and CSS, please be patient with yourselves and work to get caught up. One resource that will persist is the original MART341 site.

- [https://montana-media-arts.github.io/341-web-design-Fall2020/](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/341-web-design-Fall2020/)

The above link is to a permanent version of the MART341 site, from its first iteration. It is not a full version, but it will not change on you, or disappear. In particular, I would suggest anyone who is feeling shaky, takes the time to work through weeks 7-13 [Weeks 7-13](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/341-web-design-Fall2020).

- [Topic 6](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/341-web-design-Fall2020/topic-06/img-about/), reviews information about images in HTML & CSS, sizing images, creating background images, viewport units, and designing web layouts.
- [Topic 11](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/341-web-design-Fall2020/topic-11/box-model/), covers necessary information on the "Box Model" (padding, margin, & border), display information, float, and basic layouts.
- [Topic 12](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/341-web-design-Fall2020/topic-12/rwd-intro/), is an in-depth look at Responsive Web Design (RWD) and mobile-first design strategies. It also includes ideas for how to sketch for RWD.

I know that is a lot of review (or potentially new information, depending on your experience). However, you must understand this information before continuing with the meat of content for this semester. In particular, if the first homework assignment for this course was challenging, you should plan a significant amount of time over the next couple of weeks to review the information from weeks 7-12 of MART 341. If you would like to work through any of the concepts or techniques from those weeks, please feel free to come in during my [office hours]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/#office-hours) or set up a meeting time with me.
