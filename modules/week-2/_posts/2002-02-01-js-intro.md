After reviewing a little about the three main "languages" used by web browsers, let's discuss JavaScript in a bit more detail.

> The [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript) describes JavaScript as follows;
>
> JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complicated things on web pages. Every time a web page does more than sit there and display static information, it is usually employing JavaScript.  It could be displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, or scrolling video jukeboxes, and so on.

## Background Info

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript" title="JavaScript: JavaScript (JS) is a programming language mostly used client-side to dynamically script webpages, but often also server-side, using packages such as Node.js." class="glossaryLink">JavaScript</a> ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Dynamic_programming_language" title="dynamic programming language: A dynamic programming language&nbsp;is a programming language in which operations otherwise done at compile-time can be done at run-time. For example, in JavaScript it is possible to change the type of a variable or add new properties or methods to an object while the program is running." class="glossaryLink">dynamic programming language</a> that, when&nbsp;applied to an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML" title="HTML: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure." class="glossaryLink">HTML</a> document, can provide&nbsp;dynamic interactivity on websites.</p>

<p>JavaScript is incredibly versatile. You can start small, with carousels, image galleries, fluctuating layouts, and responses to button clicks. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!</p>

<p>JavaScript is mostly used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate webpage content through the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM" title="DOM: The DOM (Document Object Model) is an API that represents and interacts with any HTML or XML document. The DOM is a document model loaded in the browser and representing the document as a node tree, where each node represents part of the document (e.g. an element, text string, or comment)." class="glossaryLink">DOM</a>, manipulate data with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/AJAX" title="AJAX: AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) is a programming practice of combining&nbsp;HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the DOM,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;XMLHttpRequest&nbsp;object&nbsp;to build more complex&nbsp;webpages. &nbsp;What AJAX allows you to do is just&nbsp;update parts of a webpage instead of having to reload the entire page. AJAX also lets you work asynchronously, meaning your code&nbsp;continues to run&nbsp;while that part of your webpage is trying to reload&nbsp;(compared to synchronously which will block your&nbsp;code from running until that part of your webpage is done&nbsp;reloading)." class="glossaryLink">AJAX</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IndexedDB" title="IndexedDB: IndexedDB is&nbsp;a Web API for storing large data structures within browsers and indexing them for high-performance searching. Like an SQL-based RDBMS, IndexedDB is a transactional database system. However, it uses JavaScript objects rather than fixed columns tables to store data." class="glossaryLink">IndexedDB</a>, draw graphics with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/canvas" title="The definition of that term (canvas) has not been written yet; please consider contributing it!" class="glossaryLink">canvas</a>, interact with the device running the browser through various <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/API" title="APIs: An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of features and rules that exist inside a software program enabling interaction between the software and other items, such as other software or hardware." class="glossaryLink">APIs</a>, and so on. JavaScript is one of the world's most used languages, owing to the recent growth and performance improvement of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/API" title="APIs: An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of features and rules that exist inside a software program enabling interaction between the software and other items, such as other software or hardware." class="glossaryLink">APIs</a> available in browsers.</p>

<p>JavaScript itself is fairly compact yet very flexible. Developers have written a large variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of extra functionality with minimum effort. These include:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/API" title="APIs: An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of features and rules that exist inside a software program enabling interaction between the software and other items, such as other software or hardware." class="glossaryLink">APIs</a>) — APIs built into web browsers, providing functionality&nbsp;like&nbsp;dynamically creating&nbsp;HTML and setting CSS styles, collecting and manipulating&nbsp;a video stream from the user's webcam, or generating&nbsp;3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
 <li>Third-party APIs to allow developers to incorporate functionality in their sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
 <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries you can apply to your HTML to allow you to rapidly build up sites and applications.</li>
</ul>


<p>Recently, JavaScript's popularity has grown immensely, due to its use on the server with the successful <a href="http://nodejs.org/" class="external external-icon" rel="external noopener">Node.js</a> platform -&nbsp;the most popular cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment outside the browser. Node.js allows you to use JavaScript as a scripting language to automate things on a PC and build fully functional&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP" title="HTTP: HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the basic protocol that enables file transfer on the Web. HTTP is textual (all communication is done in plain text) and stateless (no communication is aware of previous communications)." class="glossaryLink">HTTP</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Web_Sockets" title="The definition of that term (Web Sockets) has not been written yet; please consider contributing it!" class="glossaryLink">Web Sockets</a> servers.</p>

> <p>Don't confuse JavaScript with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" title="Java programming language" class="external external-icon" rel="noopener">Java programming language</a>. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and uses.</p>

<p>Conceived as a server-side language by Brendan Eich (a then-employee of Netscape Corporation and future co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation), JavaScript soon came to Netscape&nbsp; Navigator 2.0 in September 1995. JavaScript enjoyed immediate success and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Microsoft_Internet_Explorer" title="Internet Explorer 3.0: Internet Explorer (or IE) is a free graphical browser maintained by Microsoft for legacy enterprise uses. Microsoft Edge is currently the default Windows browser." class="glossaryLink">Internet Explorer 3.0</a> introduced JavaScript support under the name JScript in August 1996.</p>

<p>In November 1996, Netscape began working with ECMA International to make JavaScript an industry standard. Since then, the standardized JavaScript is called ECMAScript and specified under ECMA-262, whose latest (eighth) edition is available in June 2017.</p>

## p5.js

For any of you who took the [MART120 - Creative Coding 1 course](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/120_CreativeCoding1-Fall2020/modules/week-9/overview/), you may or may not realize it, but you already know a lot about JavaScript!

[p5.js](https://p5js.org) is a JavaScript library that utilizes the power of JS but obfuscates some of its more confusing details. However, everything you learned concerning functions, variables, operators, objects, iteration, etc. will be very similar, if not identical — just an FYI.
