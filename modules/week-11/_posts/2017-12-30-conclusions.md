# Conclusions

This week focused on a couple of new elements in HTML5 mainly, the audio, video, and canvas tags.  You worked with drawing, keyEvents, and even collisions.  Do you know what that means?  You have the basics down for a game or some other kind of interactive art.  

I want you to know that I am proud of all your hard work, and I believe in each one of you!  Until next week!
