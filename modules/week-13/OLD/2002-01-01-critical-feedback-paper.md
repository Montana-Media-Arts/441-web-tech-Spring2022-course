# Final Project Option 2: Reflection Paper

As an alternative to the site-based final project, you can instead write a reflection paper about this semester that touches on a few specific topics.

If you choose this route, this paper should follow proper style guidelines (either utilize [my paper template](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/440-interactive-performance/raw/master/Projects/Documentation_and_Response/Musick_Paper_Template.doc), or follow APA, MLA, IEEE, or Chicago styles). Likewise, this paper should properly use citations and references.

The paper should discuss each of the following in some way (order is up to you);

1. How do HTML, CSS, and JavaScript relate? What is unique about them? How do they differ?
2. Please discuss JavaScripts application to current trends in front-end web development (you will need to do some independent research for this)?
3. What ways do you envision yourself using JavaScript in your workflow and creative work?
4. What specific skills have you learned in this course?
5. What skills do you wish you had learned more about in this course?

> This should be a multi-page paper that discusses these questions in-depth. The goal of this project is to offer you an opportunity to practice talking about web development, where you think it is going, and your role in this world.

## Submission

To submit your final, upload a PDF of your paper to the final project submission forum.
