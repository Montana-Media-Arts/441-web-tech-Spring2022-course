What will you do now?  Implement at least five of these.

1.  Make the character jump with the spacebar instead of the up button.
2.  Change the gravity of the stars.
3.  Change the gravity, so each star has gravity.
4.  Use different sprites for the player - look in the assets folder.
5.  Why not add some spikes you must avoid? You could create a new 'spikes' group and check for collision vs. the player, only instead of killing the spike sprite you kill the player instead. 
6.  For a non-violent style game, you could make it a speed-run and challenge them to collect the stars as quickly as possible. 
7.  Create different graphics to gather with different values if you get them.
8.  Add more platforms.
9.  Add a new level if they collect all the stars (or whatever you have on the screen). Show the current level that the player is on.
