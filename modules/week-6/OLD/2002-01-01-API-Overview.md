# API's

As you progress with JavaScript you will spend a significant amount of time working with Application Programming Interfaces or _API's_. API's serve to extend a language or technology by allowing developers access to complicated functionality or tools through simple "interfaces". These interfaces provide access to data and additional functionality, developed by someone else.
