This week we are going to review arrays as well as explore some new functions.  We will discuss how to add and remove from arrays as well as look at how to we can combine arrays and even add functions to arrays!  

Then, we will look at JSON.  We will have a short introduction to classes and objects and then look at how JSON stores information.  This storage is just a primer for what is to come next week when we dive into Classes and Objects.  (Spoiler alert: You know more than you think already).  

We will then switch focus to local storage as another way to store information and pass it between pages.  They are quite straightforward, and we won't need to leave Chrome to use it.

Finally, we will do some more hands-on work and extend our memory matching game some more.  Now, let's get after it!
