# Homework

In this homework, you are going to complete your memory matching game. You need an introduction page where you are going to first gather the player's first name, last name, age, and attempts.  Store all those items in JSON, and then put it into local storage and before going to the memory matching page.

On that memory page, allow the user to play the game.  Keep track of the user attempts required to complete the game.  When complete, update the score in the JSON object and redirect the player to the final page showing their name, age, and their final score.

Specifics:

1. Page 1 - Gather first name, last name, age
2. Add all the information to JSON and include a **attempts** key with the value of zero.
3. Allow the player to play the memory matching game.
4. Keep track of the number of attempts made to complete the game.
5. When the player finishes, redirect to the final page.
6. On the last page, display the player's name, age, and attempts.
