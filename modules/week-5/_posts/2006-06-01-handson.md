# Hands-on Work

So, we are going to continue with Code Academy.

[Arrays lessons 1-12](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/arrays/exercises/arrays?action=resume_content_item)

And here is something Khan Academy

[Debugging in p5.js](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/debugging-programs/pt/debugging-with-printlns)

In Grasshopper, I would go through the Arrays sections and the array methods to get some extra practice there too.
