# Weekly Conclusions

This week, we covered some more advanced topics, including handling web state with query strings and cookies and arrays.  We also discussed debugging, which is essential for all developers.  Next week, we will look at more array concepts along with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and JSON objects.  More arrays information, OOP, and JSON give us some background on where we want to go and how to increase our reusability.  As always, please let me know if you have any questions!
