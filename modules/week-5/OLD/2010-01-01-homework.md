# Homework

For your homework this week, you will write five programs that print their results to a web console. To get started, please download the following Zip directory. This contains a blank `readme.md` and a JavaScript document with instructions for each problem.

> NOTE: These problems come from the "Eloquent JavaScript" book. There are also solutions in this book. You are welcome to reference the solutions from the book to assist you in solving the problems for yourself. HOWEVER, I do expect that you complete your own work. If your code is evidently copied from the book solutions, you will receive a 0 for the assignment.
