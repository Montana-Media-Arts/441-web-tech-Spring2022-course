# Homework

In this homework, you are going to work with AJAX and jQuery.  You are going to have to learn a new concept on your own, however.  I gave you tools to access a JSON file via AJAX in JavaScript, and I also talked about accessing data using jQuery, but I didn't show you exactly how to obtain a JSON file using jQuery.  

However, I will not leave you high and dry, and in fact, I will give you a hint -- a massive clue.  Go here: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/ajax_getjson.asp" target="_new">JQuery and JSON</a>.  It gives you an example of how to access a JSON file in jQuery and iterate over the data returned.

Next, you choose a dataset from one of these data sets <a href="https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets" target="_new">Cool Datasets</a> or something else that looks interesting to you.  I suggest just copying the data from the page and creating a new page locally so that you have a local copy of the data, and you don't have to worry about the cross-domain issue. 

From there, you are going to make something show up from the JSON. Your goal is to make it show up in a pleasing way that is easily understood by the end-user.

Also, you are going to create a simple yet workable jQuery plugin that you can apply to the data returned from your dataset.

Technical Specifications:

1. Find a dataset to display
2. Use jQuery and AJAX to access the JSON file
3. Display your data in a meaningful way
4. Create a jQuery plugin that you can apply to your data as well.
