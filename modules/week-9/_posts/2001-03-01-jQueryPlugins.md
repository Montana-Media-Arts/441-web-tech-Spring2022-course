Let's switch gears now and utilize some of the jQuery plugins that are out there.  What is a jQuery plugin?  These are further abstractions of jQuery to make some effect.  A plugin is a custom function using jQuery, and then all you have to do is reference the plugin and call the function to utilize it.  That is a good thing!  Let's look at some examples:

There are ones that allow us to scroll through pictures in a different way.

There are ones that do face detection.

There are ones that help make our menus look a little prettier.

The following plugins help with lettering.

And ones that even help with popups, so they look better and keep us on the page.

There are so many more, and I encourage you to check them out as they will help you give your users an even fuller experience.  Many of them have demos, and though they might look a little complicated at first as you dig through them, you will realize that you know more than you think!
