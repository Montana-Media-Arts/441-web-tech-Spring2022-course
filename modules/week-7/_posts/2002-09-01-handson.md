# Hands on work

Code Academy has a nice section on objects.  I think you will find it helpful if you go through the exercises:

<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-objects/lessons/objects/exercises/intro?action=lesson_resume&course_redirect=introduction-to-javascript" target="_new">Code Academy Objects</a>

In Grasshopper, there is a section in the Practice that covers Object Expressions.  That should give some practice on properties, functions, etc.

Finally, in W3Schools, there is a section on JavaScript objects that I think is helpful too.
