On the last page, you learned the basic structure for creating a **constructor**, and you learned about **input parameters**. What was not discussed, was how to then deal with this input parameter data or where to store it.

To store data inside a specific object, we will use a syntax known as **this**. You can think of it as creating a variable inside the class that we can access later from the object. Whew.. we will look at examples.  I promise!

Let's go back to our Person class. I reduced the number of properties to make it easy to digest.  Let's look at how this might work:

```html
<html>

<head>
    <title>OOP</title>
    <script>
        class Person{
            constructor()
            {
                this.eyeColor = "blue";
                this.hairColor = "red";
            }
            showInformation()
            {
                document.getElementById("person").innerHTML = "Eye Color: " + this.eyeColor + "<br>Hair Color: " + this.hairColor;
            }   
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="person"></div>

</body>
</html>
```
In this code, the class initializes the hair and eye color **will be** through the constructor.  Notice, nothing has been created yet.  However, the **this** keyword allows us to get the properties in the class.

#### No input parameters to the constructor

You do not need to send any input parameters to the constructor.  Calling a constructor without parameters invokes the default constructor. This allows you to give `default` values to your properties. 

```js
 class Person{
    constructor()
    {
        this.eyeColor = "blue";
        this.hairColor = "red";
        
    }
}
```

In this example, `this.eyeColor` will have a value of `blue`, and `this.hairColor` will have a value of `red`, which will be attached to any new object instances of class type `Person`.

#### You Will Forget 'this'

Never fear, if you forget **this.**.  It is common, and it can cause errors.  However, you are well-equipped to handle the mistakes now that you have debugging skills.  So, go back to what you know and see what you can figure out.

One more thing, though, if you create a variable without `this`, it will become a global variable accessible anywhere.

```js
 class Person{
    constructor()
    {
        this.eyeColor = "blue";
        this.hairColor = "red";
        eyeColor = "green";
    }
}
```

Remember the property, `this.eyeColor`, will be attached to any new object instances of class type `Person`. However, the eyeColor two lines later create a new JavaScript global variable, known as 'eyeColor'. This new variable us attached to the JavaScript environment and **NOT** any new `Person` objects.

## Pass Input Parameters to a constructor

To pass any input parameters specified in a _constructor_ to a new instance of an object, they need to be assigned to the **this** properties. The following would take an eyeColor and hairColor value passed to the `Person` object, and attach it to the object's eyeColor and hairColor properties, respectively.

```js
class Person{
        constructor(eyeColor, hairColor)
        {
            this.eyeColor = eyeColor;
            this.hairColor = hairColor;
        }
    }
```

The above may look funny. If we can pass input parameters into the _constructor_, why should they need to be re-assigned to an object property? There are many reasons for this, but merely coming up with variables names gets hard after a while.

One more thing, in JavaScript, you can only have one constructor defined. In other languages, you can have multiple constructors.

# Accessing Object Properties

To access an object property from within the class definition, you also will use *this* notation by appending the variable name to `this`.

```js
class Person{
    constructor(eyeColor, hairColor)
    {
        this.eyeColor = eyeColor;
        this.hairColor = hairColor;
    }
    showInformation()
    {
        document.getElementById("person").innerHTML = "Eye Color: " + this.eyeColor + "<br>Hair Color: " + this.hairColor;
    }
}
```

So, how do we create new objects from classes?
