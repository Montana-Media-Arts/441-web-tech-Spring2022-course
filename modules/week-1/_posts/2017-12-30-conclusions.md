## Conclusions

That is it for Week 1. I hope you are excited for this course and everything we are going to learn this semester.

Remember, if you need help, you should try using the course ["Issues Forum" hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/441-WebTech-Spring2021-Examples/issues).

## Study Groups

Another strategy I would suggest you adopt, regardless of whether you need help right now, is to form a study/work group for this class. Consider reaching out to your fellow classmates. You could do this through the Issues Forum or Discord.

## Date Information

If you have not noticed yet, active module dates are posted up above, along with the deadline for the week's homework.

As a gentle reminder, you homework is due by {{ site.data.dates[1][1] }}.
