# Final Project Option 1: Portfolio Site

Your first final project option is to build a portfolio site. I will lead the specific scope of this portfolio site very open so as to account for the various types of portfolio sites you all might make. However, as an example, these sites might be focused to do one of the following;

1. Represent your creative technology based artwork and the types of projects you are currently engaging in. The goal of this is not necessarily for job applications, but instead to serve as a repository about your art and code.
2. Be a site aimed at getting you a job as a front-end developer.
3. Be a site aimed at getting you a job as a more general creative technologist.
4. Be a site aimed at getting you a different type of job (please specify).


The goal of this final project option is to give you a chance to work on your portfolio site for your personal goals or career goals.

With regard to technical details, you may;

- code a site from scratch that best suites the needs of your portfolio
    - this could be done as a static site using HTML, CSS, and JS
- use an existing template and alter it to fit your needs
- build a wordpress, or druple site (you may not use wordpress.com, you must host somewhere with a wordpress.org site)
- build a Jekyll site (that is what this course uses)

If you have an existing portfolio, you are also welcome to update it, utilizing information gleamed from this semester. (Again, this assumes it is not a wordpress.com, or other high-level site like Wix, where you have not changed anything.) If you are unsure of what is and is not allowed, please feel free to email me.

## Submission

To submit your final, create a readme as usual that discusses your process, goals, and work. Submit a link to the readme and the live site. You will submit these to the final project submission forum.
