This is the website for the online section of _Web Technologies ( MART 441 )_ offered by [The School of Media Arts, University of Montana](http://www.umt.edu/mediaarts/).

Building on the principles and techniques covered in [Intro to Web Design ( MART 341 )](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/341-web-design-Fall2020/), this project-based class focuses on media integration, interactivity, client-side development, and server-side development for the presentation and development of artistic websites.

This online advanced web technologies course will explore the latest in web technologies. This will began with a refresher of HTML5 and CSS3. Next will be a thorough exploration of JavaScript (JS) for client-side site development and interaction. The final topic will touch on the power of JS and node.js for server-side development. A number of JavaScript libraries will be explored for how they can speed up the artistic process.
